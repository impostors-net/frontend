                Have you ever wondered if there’s an online version of Impostor?
                <br>
                If so, you’ve probably noticed that 
                <br>
                there aren’t many true online versions, just some cheap Knock-offs.
                <br>
                That’s why we decided to create our own , fully online version of IMPOSTOR!
                How the Game Works:
                <br>
                In Impostor, you can make Posts and also comment under them,
                <br>
                In each Post, Users are either Innocents or The Impostor.
                <br>
                All Innocents can see the initial Post and comment under it aswell.
                <br>
                The Impostor cannot see the Post but only the comments
                <br>
                and has to blend in by making a comment based on the other players’ comments.
                <br>
                Players can upvote or downvote each other's comments.
                <br>
                After 7 day round ends and the Impostor is revealed.
                <br>
                You will get Rewards according to your up and down Votes
                <br>
                if you Downvote the comment of an Impostor as an Innocent you will gain Points, Badges and Rewards
                <br>
                if you get Upvotes as an Impostor you gain Points, Badges and Rewards
                <br>
